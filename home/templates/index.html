    <h3 id="heading">Purpose of project</h3>
    <p id="paragraph" style="padding: 20px; padding-top: 0%;">CAPTCHAs' purpose is to prevent spam on websites, such as
      promotion
      spam, registration spam, and data scraping, and bots are less likely to abuse
      websites with spamming if those websites use CAPTCHA. Breaking those human
      interaction proofs for Automated-work can be a crucial task as it was specially
      designed for only humans to crack. However, detection of CAPTCHA can make
      the work of a human easy and decrease the time consumed in such work.</p>

      <p>We have developed CAPTCHA solver which can solve CAPTCHA generated using Python captcha library.<br> Click
        below to try our model</p>

    <h3 style="padding-top: 20px;">Problems and weakness of current system</h3>
    <p style="padding: 20px; padding-top: 0%;">In our system, there are limitations for the number of characters of
      CAPTCHA, time complexity and space complexity. There are only few CAPTCHA
      types which can be detected as the segmentation of each near character which
      could be stuck next to each other or so much unresolvable. There are some
      limitations while recognition of CAPTCHA for uploading the image as there should
      be some dimension, colour contrast, padding and stretching.</p>
    <h3>Future extension</h3>
    <p style="padding: 20px; padding-top: 0%;">We planned to train model such it can detect zebra crossing in any given
      image, which is used in Google ReCAPTCHA 2.0. We even trained model But due to lack of data images
      and resources, accuracy is very low. Model is trained with 442 images
      (Zebra Crossing (224) + Non zebra crossing (218)). There are about 100 mixed
      random Images for testing</p>
